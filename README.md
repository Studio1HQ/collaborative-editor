## Features

- User authentication with Auth0
- Real-time comments, @mentions, notifications, and user presence using Velt
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- Collaborative rich text editing with React Quill

## Prerequisites

- Auth0 account and application (Client ID, Client Secret, Domain)
- A Velt account and API key
- Node.js 16.8 or later

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/studio1hq/nextjs-velt-firebase-app.git
cd collaborative-editor
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Create a .env.local file in the root directory and add your Auth0 and Velt API keys:

```
AUTH0_SECRET=your-long-random-secret
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
AUTH0_DOMAIN=https://YOUR_DOMAIN.auth0.com
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_VELT_API_KEY=your-velt-api-key
```

You can generate the Auth0 secret by running `openssl rand -hex 32` in your terminal. Get the Auth0 credentials from your Auth0 dashboard after creating an application. The Velt API key is available in your Velt dashboard.

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
